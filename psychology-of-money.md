# The Psychology of money

## Tail, you win

1. The odds of tails happening is small by nature. However, the reward that comes with the tail events are often so great that it would compensate the whole distribution.
2. This applies not only to investing, it applies to all aspects of life too.
3. We don't need to be exactly right, but roughly right and on the right direction is enough when we are making decisions that could change life.
4. The greatest "X" is often the one that could pick out a few important one that could give us excess returns. If we ignore those, then the excess return of doing something would diminish and become just as normal as some others.
