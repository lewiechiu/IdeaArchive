# 資管與資工系的選擇 - 三年後

## 現況

我在畢業後順利的找到軟體工程師的工作，一年後順利地進到台灣 Google，跟許許多多來自各校資工系，的人一起工作。

在電機系曾經找一位教授一起跟著做研究，雖然當時後沒有產出結果，但讓我釐清我自己不喜歡機器學習，更喜歡實作東西。

工作上，很偶爾會接觸到大學時代學習到的東西。舉凡像是作業系統，網路，硬體層面的東西。

雖然成為一位厲害的工程師，技術背景很重要。但要能夠在一群大神中卓越的表現，不能夠只單靠努力就能夠達成

## 反思

### 課程規劃

如果可以再有一次機會重新選擇，我依然還是會選擇走資管系。

學會軟性技能，在工作上，我發覺如果工程師能夠『精準的表達自己』，『學會有效率地利用時間』

工作雖然大多是技術相關，但是把維度拉高以後，其實在解決的本質都是商業問題。而這就是資管系的價值吧，我們能夠懂商業上想要做到什麼事情，
也能夠理解技術上要怎麼實踐。

學習團隊合作。在工作上，完全不可能自己一個人單獨完成一件事情，必然是個個不同角色（前端，後端，數據分析，PM，設計師等等）一起合作。而如果在大學的時候，沒有多練習跟不同角色的人合作，學習如何跟不同職能合作

培養學習的習慣，

## 職涯選擇

* 以現在流行的趨勢來說，大家都想要做軟體工程。人人都想要有機會可以嘗試機器學人，人工智慧
* 從就業的角度來看，企業對於資管資工科系，並沒有明顯的差異。除了

現實層面來說

* 選資管系你除了可以在探索的階段中，有更多選擇。你能夠接觸到異質性更高的一群人
* 能夠接觸到不同的觀點，能夠體驗管院的生活對於自己來說，是不是嚮往的。
