## Summary

- Talked about how the interview process at Google is like
- For software engineers to succeed in Google interviews, one should focus on being flexible and peculiar about details.

## Context and Background

I was approached by a head hunter during the pandemic. At that time (around Oct. 2021), most tech companies are growing in a rapid speed. This is when most of us got into the tech industry because of the need for hiring more talent. I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to get to interview at my dream company. Though the interview process was hard as I have heard before, I decided to give it a shot and try to prove myself.

I think my background is very similar to the majority of people who tries to get into top tech companies. I graduated majoring in information management. I didn't participate in any competitive programming or hackathons nor did I create some killer Github side-projects. I was just a normal student as most of us did. 

## The Preparation

I don't want to give generic answers like "Just do a lot of Leetcode and you'll succeed" or things like "Go through CTCI and then Leetcode and then XXX and YYY". There are already lots of articles on the internet providing generic content.

> Hard work is a necessity to become good at solving coding interviews, luck is also needed to pass the interview.

To be fair though, a good amount of leetcode is necessary. But after a certain amount, the progress plataus. You won't feel the progress as much as when you started to leetcode. There are an infinite amount of questions out in the world. So, it doesn't make much sense to finish all of the questions. The key point to remember is to capture the essence of how each topic will be asked. For instance, when asked BFS/DFS questions, look for the loop conditions, how to extend to advanced data structures.

**Follow the same topic**: A general rule of thumb for preparing tech / coding interviews is to do at least 10 on each of the topics appeared in Leetcode. When doing the leetcode questions, make sure you solve the same tag / categories all at once. This will get you a feeling of how the questions may evolve.

Don't worry about having to solve more than 500, 700+ questions before going to an actual interview. What matters most is if you have understood how each topic would be flexed to different scenarios. A good starting point for an interview, from my experience, is about 100 questions. After that, try to focus on interviewing skills and practice how to make effective coding practices.

Effective coding practices: Make the leetcode process a lot like the actual interview process. This means a few things, you got to solve 2 medium questions or a 1 easy + 1 hard questions in 45 minutes period. Also, you should think out loud, talk through the coding process and make sure you have explained every piece of pseudocode. following some interview templates, and recording the time. It may sound intimidating on how the preparation should be, but it will make the actual interview less scary.

> Interviews have formal templates to allow us follow through. This way, we don't need to worry about not getting right.

## The actual interview

There are lots of details to focus on here. I'll list o

- Always ask for clarifications and/or speak out about what you "assume" the questions to be.
- Always write pseudocode and functions.
- Talk as you write, write as you talk.
- Don't rush to an answer.
